## Kisumu Language

**Date**: _September 28, 2024_

## 1. Overview

The kisumu project aims to develop a new interpreted programming language using Go, with a syntax similar to Go. The language will support basic data structures and operations, and we are integrating tools for code formatting, linting, dependency management, static analysis, and testing.

## 2. Completed Tasks

### **1. Language Core Implementation**

- **Parser and Interpreter**: The initial implementation of the parser and interpreter is complete. The parser converts kisumu code into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), and the interpreter executes the AST.

- **Data Structures**: Basic implementations for Number, String, Boolean, Null, Array, and Object/Hash data structures have been developed. Methods for these data structures, such as `length`, `first`, and `get`, are also in place.

### **2. Tooling**

- **Code Formatter**: A preliminary code formatter has been developed. It reformats kisumu code to ensure consistency in indentation and spacing.

- **Linter**: The linter has been implemented and is functioning to enforce coding standards and detect potential issues in kisumu code.

- **Static Code Analyzer**: The static code analyzer is in place, capable of scanning kisumu code for common mistakes and potential issues.

- **Test Runner**: The basic test framework has been set up using Goâ€™s testing package. Tests for the parser, interpreter, formatter, linter, and static analyzer have been written and are running successfully.

### **3. Project Structure**

- **Updated Project Structure**: The project structure has been revised to include components for code formatting, linting, dependency management, static analysis, and testing. A Makefile has been created for build automation, and a CI configuration file for GitHub Actions is set up.

## 3. Ongoing Tasks

### **1. Refinement and Optimization**

- **Formatter Enhancements**: Continuing to enhance the code formatter to handle edge cases and improve formatting consistency.

- **Linter Rules**: Expanding and refining the linter rules to cover more coding standards and practices.

- **Dependency Manager**: Working on implementing a simple dependency management system for future library support.

### **2. Testing and Quality Assurance**

- **Test Coverage**: Increasing test coverage to ensure all features and edge cases are adequately tested. Additional tests are being added for new functionality.

- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Fine-tuning the CI/CD pipeline to ensure reliable and consistent build and test processes. We are addressing any issues found during the initial runs.

## 4. Next Steps

### **1. Feature Completion**

- **Finalize Data Structure Methods**: Implement additional methods and functionalities for data structures as needed.

- **Dependency Management**: Complete the development of the dependency manager if required.

### **2. Tool Improvements**

- **Enhance Static Analyzer**: Improve the static code analyzer with more advanced checks and better reporting.

- **Code Formatter and Linter Integration**: Ensure that the code formatter and linter are fully integrated and working together seamlessly in the development workflow.

### **3. Documentation and User Guide**

- **Documentation**: Begin drafting documentation for kisumu, including usage guides, examples, and contributions guidelines.

- **User Guide**: Develop a comprehensive user guide to help users get started with kisumu and utilize its features effectively.

## 5. Issues and Challenges

- **Performance Optimization**: There are some performance issues with the interpreter that need optimization. Efforts are ongoing to address these.

- **Tool Integration**: Ensuring smooth integration of the formatter, linter, and other tools into the development environment has presented some challenges, but progress is being made.

## 6. Conclusion

The kisumu project is progressing well with significant milestones achieved in implementing core functionalities and tooling. Ongoing efforts are focused on refining and optimizing these components, enhancing testing, and preparing comprehensive documentation. We are on track to deliver a robust and functional programming language with the planned features.
