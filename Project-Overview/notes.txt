Stack-based language

Operations:

> pop
> add
> sub
> jump.eq.0
> print
> read
> jump.gt.0
> halt//


interpreter.go
- retrieve the program file path from command line
- parse the program file
- use a token counter to keep track of the program file
- split the program file into tokens
- if the Operation code ends with a token then the program file is split into tokens and
executes the operation

Tokenization: The goal of tokenization is to split the file/input into a stream of character/tokens that can easily understood.
> It is the process of analyzing a string of symbols, either in natural language, computer languages(machine code) or data structures.
> Split source code into meaningful tokens.

AST(abstract syntax tree)
> DS that represents the program's structure.
> Produced by processing the tokens received from the lexer(parsing).
> Pratt Parsing technique

> REPL(Read-Eval-Print-Loop) ~ interactive programming environment that allows users to enter code, which is then executed and its results is displayed immediately.
    ~ Read: read user input
    ~ Eval: evaluates the code by executing it
    ~ Print: prints the result of the execution
    ~ Loop: loop back to read the next input
